    <string name="about_header">About:</string>
    <string name="about_blurb">Adaline Theatre House opened in 2007 in a beautiful wooded glade close to the lake in the
grounds of Kilworth House Hotel in south Leicestershire. There\'s a special aura and magic
about open-air theatre on a beautiful English summer\â€™s evening, so what better way to experience that magic than amidst the magnificent surroundings of the Kilworth estate, 
enjoying a professional production of a standard rarely seen outside the West End of London.</string>
